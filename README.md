## What is Dojo?

Dojo is a place of training for various kinds of martial arts. The household

respect between members of a common household through its various
organizational features. The payment and task tracking features of ‘Dojo’
ultimately aim to improve the communication and relationships amongst
members by providing a common space for them to stay organized,
respect their common space, and be held accountable for responsibilities
